# 🔧 Voice Network Error Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**
"Speech recognition error: network" after 1-2 minutes of continuous listening.

### **Root Cause:**
- Browser's Web Speech API has built-in timeout limits (~60-90 seconds)
- Network connectivity hiccups cause recognition to fail
- Long listening sessions hit service limits

## ✅ **The Solution: Auto-Restart Magic**

### **What We Fixed:**
• **Smart Recovery** - Automatically restarts speech recognition on network errors
• **Seamless Continuity** - User doesn't notice the restart, conversation continues
• **Error Classification** - Different handling for network vs other errors
• **Visual Feedback** - "Reconnecting..." indicator instead of scary error messages

### **How It Works:**
1. **Network Error Detected** → Show "Reconnecting..." with pulse indicator
2. **Auto-Restart** → Silently restart speech recognition (500ms delay)
3. **Seamless Resume** → Continue listening without user intervention
4. **Smart Retry** → Multiple restart attempts with exponential backoff

### **User Experience Before:**
```
User talks for 90 seconds → "Speech recognition error: network" → 
Recording stops → User frustrated → Has to click button again
```

### **User Experience Now:**
```
User talks for 90 seconds → Brief "Reconnecting..." indicator → 
Automatically resumes → User keeps talking → Zero interruption
```

### **Technical Implementation:**
- `autoRestartEnabled` flag prevents restart loops
- Timeout scheduling prevents rapid cycling
- Callback preservation maintains state across restarts
- Proper cleanup on manual stop

### **Visual Indicators:**
• 🟢 **Green pulse** - Active listening
• 🟡 **Yellow pulse** - Reconnecting after network error
• 🔴 **Red error** - Serious errors that need user attention

### **Error Types Handled:**
- `network` - Auto-restart with "Reconnecting..."
- `no-speech` - Auto-restart (common timeout)
- Other errors - Show to user (permissions, etc.)

## 🎯 **Result: Rock-Solid Voice Experience**
