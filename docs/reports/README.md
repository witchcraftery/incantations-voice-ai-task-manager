## 📝 Reporting Guidelines

### When to Create a Report

Create a report for any work that involves:
- Implementing new features
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Performance improvements
- UI/UX enhancements
- Infrastructure changes
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding new tools or processes

### File Naming Convention

Use this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Examples:
- `2025-01-06-floating-chat-bubble.md`
- `2025-01-06-deepgram-tts-chunking.md`
- `2025-01-06-sidebar-collapse-persistence.md`

### Required Report Sections

Each report must include:

1. **Summary** - Brief description of what was done
2. **Problem/Need** - What issue was addressed or feature requested
3. **Solution** - How the problem was solved
4. **Files Changed** - List of modified/created files
5. **Testing** - How the changes were validated
6. **Impact** - Benefits and potential considerations
7. **Documentation Updates** - Any docs that were updated
8. **Follow-up** - Known issues or future improvements needed

### Report Template

Copy the template from `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for consistent formatting.

## 🔄 Integration with Development Workflow

1. **During Work**: Take notes on changes and reasoning
2. **After Completion**: Create detailed report before moving to next task
3. **Before Handoff**: Ensure report is complete and accurate
4. **Documentation Review**: Reports feed into official documentation updates
