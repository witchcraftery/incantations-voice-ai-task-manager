# Synchronization Workflow Steps (for your local macOS documentation):

1. Compare deployed-temp vs Local Branch
•  Use git diff deployed-temp..HEAD to identify differences
•  Check configuration changes, dependencies, and compatibility
•  Verify build process and deployment configs
•  Review API changes for backward compatibility

2. Create Merged/Main Branch from Desired State
•  Create integration branch from deployed-temp as base
•  Merge local development changes strategically
•  Resolve conflicts and validate through full test suite
•  Update main branch with validated integration state

3. Deploy Validated Branch to DigitalOcean
•  Run pre-deployment checklist (env vars, backups, health checks)
•  Deploy via DigitalOcean App Platform (git-based or manual)
•  Perform post-deployment verification and monitoring
•  Have rollback procedure ready if needed

### DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS!
- If folders look like they've been duplicated within themselves, say something.
- If you suspect that git push or deployment may be overwriting more recent updates, pause and say something. 
- If you see an opportunity for more streamlined and safe processes, say something.
